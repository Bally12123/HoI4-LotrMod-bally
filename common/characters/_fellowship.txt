characters={

	# DOCUMENTATION:
	# - All the characters here can at some point or another be part of the fellowship
	# - All these characters are recruited by the Shire (because in order to be used, SOME country needs to recruit them).
	# 		Make sure they are not visible.
	# - The "name" property will be displayed on UI, but will also dictate their portrait.
	# 		Example: name = "Frodo", will mean the character will have a portrait of "GFX_fs_member_Frodo" in the GUI
	# - Each char should be a "corps_commander", where each of the stats reflects some custom attribute:
	# 		- attack_skill:		The damage this character does in combat
	# 		- defense_skill:	The amount of damage this character can take before dying
	# 		- planning_skill:	'Stealth skill'. For defenders/fellowship: increases chance at not being detected/avoiding combat
	# 							For attackers: Chance at finding/locating the fellowship during an interception attempt
	# 		- logistics_skill:	'Dexterity skill'. Chance at dodging avoiding/attacks
