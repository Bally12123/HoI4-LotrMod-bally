# The ideologies in the LOTR mod are somewhat funky.
# 
# There are four "groups", which are the ones that show on the pie-chart:
# - belligerent 	(bad guys)
# - cooperative 	(good guys)
# - unaligned		(neutral guys)
# - revolutionary	(weird guys)
# 
# Each group has a set of "political stances", which are coded as that groups sub-ideologies (or ideology types).
# Refer to 00_ideologies.txt for a detailed account of these.
# 
# If you add/remove any of these, make sure to ammend the following file, so that the localization etc. still work:
# in scripted_localisation/subideology_scripted_localization.txt add an entry for their localization and their icon
# 
# Our icons are located in (TODO...) and declared in (TODO...)
# 
# 
# Switching from one stance to another, is as simple as running (for example) "set_country_leader_ideology = isolationist".
# 
# In scripted_effects/(TODO...) we have automatic events that switch stanced depending on circumstances.
